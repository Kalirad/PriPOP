Data and code associated with:

Kalirad & Sommer, _The role of plasticity and stochasticity in coexistence_

## Contents:

+ pripop.py: The _PriPOP_ model written in Python 3.8.

+ demo.ipynb: Jupyter notebook illustrating how to simulate a population using the _PriPOP_ model.

+ bayesian_analyses.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to analyze experimental data on mouth-form and fecundity data using a Bayesian approach.

+ sim_inputs.zip: the synthetic mouth-form and fecundity data, based on the experimental data from _Pristionchus pacificus_, used by _PriPOP_ model.

+ MF_ratios.csv: the experimental measurements of mouth-form plasticity for strains A, B, and C across two bacterial diets. Columns labels: Strain indicates if a worm belongs to strain A (RSC017), strain B (RSC017), or strain C (RS5405), Culture indicates if the worms were grown on either _E. coli_ OP50 (OP50) or _Novosphingobium_ sp. L76(Novo), Eu indicates the number of predatory adults, Total indicates the total number of adults assayed, the Replicate indicates biological replicates.

+ comb_fec_data.csv: the experimental daily egg-laying data for strains A, B, and C across two bacterial diets. Columns labels: Worm ID identifies the worms that were assayed during the fecundity assay, Strain indicates if a worm belongs to strain A (RSC017), strain B (RSC017), or strain C (RS5405), Day indicates each day of the fecundity assay, Progeny Count is the number of eggs laid by a given worm at the end of each day, and Diet indicates if the assay was conducted on either _E. coli_ OP50 (OP50) or _Novosphingobium_ sp. L76(Novo)
